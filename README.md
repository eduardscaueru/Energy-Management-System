# Energy-Management-System
The project is based on the simulation of an energy system for a given number of months in which we will have different entities with well-defined attributions such as:
- Producers, who provide an amount of energy monthly to the distributors for a specified price per kWh. They also have a maximum number of distributors affiliated to them.
- Distributors, who provide energy to the consumers based on a contract which can last one or more months. They need to pay taxes at the end of every month. Distributors choose the producers based on the type of the strategy given in the input which can be one of the following: Green Strategy (the producers are sort first by renewable energy, then by price and in the end by quantity), Price Strategy (the producers are sort by price, then by quantity) and Quantity Strategy (the producers are sort only by quantity).
- Consumers recieve the energy from the distributor whos contract is active and pay them monthly, but they also recieve a monthly salary. Consumers may delay a contract payment for one month if they have no money but they must pay it next month along with the current month. They choose their distributor based on the smallest contract value.
